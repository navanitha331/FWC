\item  Prove that:$\brak{\frac{\sin A - 2sin^3 A}{2 \cos^3 A-\cos A} = \tan A }$

	\item A plane left $30$ minutes late than its scheduled time and in order to reach the destination $1500$ km away in time, it had to increase  its speed by $100 km/h$ from the usual speed. Find its usual speed.

	\item A motor boat whose speed is $18  km/hr$ in still water takes $1hr$ more to go $24 km$ upstream than to return downstream to the same spot. Find the speed of the stream.
		\item A train travels at a certain average speed for a distance of $63$ km and then travels at a distance of $72$ km at an average speed of $6 km/hr$ more than its original speed. If it takes $3$ hours to complete total journey, what is the original average speed?

	\item $ABCD$ is a rectangle. Find the values of $x$ and $y$.
